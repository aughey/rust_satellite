//! # Gateway Devices
//! These are structs that implement the traits defined in the `traits` crate
//! that forward commands to a device over a TCP connection.  The gateway
//! is intended to ship properly formatted bits down to a leaf device in a 
//! binary format specifically formatted for that device.  This eliminates
//! the need for the leaf device to do ascii parsing, image scaling, and image
//! conversion.
