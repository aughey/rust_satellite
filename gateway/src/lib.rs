//! # Gateway
//! The gateway is a TCP server that accepts connections from leaf satellite devices
//! and connects to a companion app.  The gateway forwards commands from the companion
//! app to the satellite device and forwards commands from the satellite device to the
//! companion app.
//! 
//! The protocol between the gateway and the companion app is a binary protocol with the
//! images encoded in the format expected by the leaf device.  This allows the leaf device
//! to be a simple device that just forwards the commands to the connected Streamdeck hardware.
//! 
//! The intent of the gateway is to allow the leaf satellite devices to be trivially implemented
//! and could be implmeneted on a microcontroller with a TCP stack and a USB connection to the
//! Streamdeck hardware.
